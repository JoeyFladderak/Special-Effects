The aim for this project was to create a collection of special effects commonly found in games. The special effects varied to model shaders, post processing effects and small systems, like a basic particle system and a lens flare system. It was mandatory that all the post processing effect could work separately and combined from each other.

The effects and their implementations were made in an already existing framework as an exercise to work within existing frameworks and build needed functionality into it without breaking the existing code base.
